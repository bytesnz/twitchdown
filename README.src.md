Dead simple Markdown parser for react-like libraries

## Kudos
Kudos goes to [Jason Miller](https://github.com/developit) and the contributors
to [Snarkdown](https://github.com/developit) as this is based off their hard
work

## Features
- Still fast
- Still small
- Still simply - pass a Markdown string, get an array of components (created with the given `createElement` function)
- Use custom `{@ }` tags and handlers
- Add `<p>` tags around text
- Integrate with code highlighters like
  [react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter)
- Minified version included (`require('twitchdown/index.min')`)

## Example
For a more "real life" example with lazy loading, see the
